# Classifier Spec — Pod Classifier

Complete this spec **before** writing any code for Milestone 2.

Use Plan or Ask mode to think through each blank field. When you're done,
your answers here become the blueprint for `build_few_shot_prompt()` and
`classify_episode()` in `classifier.py`.

---

## build_few_shot_prompt(labeled_examples, description)

### What it does
Constructs a prompt string for the LLM that includes the task instructions,
all labeled training examples, and the new episode description to classify.

### Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `labeled_examples` | `list[dict]` | Each dict has `"title"`, `"description"`, `"label"` (and others). These are the examples you labeled in Milestone 1. |
| `description` | `str` | The episode description to classify. |

### Output

| Return value | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| prompt | `str` | A complete prompt string ready to send to the LLM. |

### Spec fields — fill these in before writing code

**Task instruction (what should the LLM know about the task?):**

```
You are classifying podcast episodes by their format. Classify the episode
into exactly one of these four labels:

- interview: a conversation between a host and one or more guests
- solo: a single host speaking from memory, experience, or opinion — no guests,
  no assembled external sources
- panel: multiple guests with roughly equal speaking time, often debating or
  discussing a topic together
- narrative: a story assembled from external sources — interviews, archival
  audio, reporting — with a clear narrative arc

Return only the label and your reasoning. Do not explain the taxonomy.
```

---

**How should labeled examples be formatted in the prompt?**

```
Each example should include the episode title, a brief excerpt or the full
description, and the correct label. Separate examples with a blank line or
a delimiter like "---". Include all fields that help the model see why the
label was applied — title and description are both useful; other fields
(like episode ID) are not needed.
```

---

**Example block sketch (write one concrete example):**

```
Title: {title}
Description: {description}
Label: {label}
```

---

**How should the new episode (to be classified) be presented?**

```
Present it in the same format as the labeled examples, but omit the Label
line and replace it with an instruction to classify. For example:

Title: {title}
Description: {description}
Label: ?

Then add a line like: "Classify the episode above. Return your answer in
the format below:" followed by the output format you chose.
```

---

**What output format should you request from the LLM?**

```
Use this format:

Label: <label>
Reasoning: <one sentence explanation>

Why: "Label: X" on its own line is easy to parse with a simple split — find
the line starting with "Label:", take everything after the colon, strip and
lowercase. JSON is more brittle (the model may add markdown code fences or
trailing commas). A bare label with no structure makes it hard to extract
reasoning reliably. This format balances parsability and readability.
```

---

**Edge cases to handle in the prompt:**

```
- Empty labeled_examples: include a note in the prompt that no examples are
  available and ask the model to classify using only the label definitions.
  The classifier will be less accurate but won't crash.
- Very short description (< ~20 chars): no special handling needed — pass it
  through as-is. The model will classify with whatever signal exists.
- Description is None or empty string: guard in classify_episode() before
  calling build_few_shot_prompt(); return {"label": "unknown", "reasoning":
  "Empty description"} immediately.
```

---

## classify_episode(description, labeled_examples)

### What it does
Classifies a single podcast episode description using the few-shot LLM classifier.
Returns a dict with a label and reasoning.

### Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `description` | `str` | The episode description to classify. |
| `labeled_examples` | `list[dict]` | Labeled training examples from `load_labeled_examples()`. |

### Output

| Return value | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| result | `dict` | Must have keys `"label"` and `"reasoning"`. `"label"` must be one of `VALID_LABELS` or `"unknown"`. |

---

### Spec fields — fill these in before writing code

**Step 1 — Build the prompt:**

```
Call build_few_shot_prompt(labeled_examples, description) and store the
returned string in a variable (e.g., prompt). Pass through both arguments
exactly as received — no modification needed before calling.
```

---

**Step 2 — Send to the LLM:**

```
Call _client.chat.completions.create() with:
  - model: the model name from config (LLM_MODEL)
  - messages: a list with one dict — {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    (system-design.md shows an optional system message too — either shape works)
  - max_tokens: a reasonable limit (e.g., 200–300) to keep responses concise

Extract the response text from:
  response.choices[0].message.content
```

---

**Step 3 — Parse the response:**

```
Iterate over the lines of the response text. For each line:
  - If it starts with "label:" (case-insensitive), extract the text after the
    colon, strip whitespace, and convert to lowercase → this is the raw label.
  - If it starts with "reasoning:" (case-insensitive), extract the text after
    the colon, strip whitespace → this is the reasoning string.

Example:
  for line in response_text.strip().splitlines():
      lower = line.lower()
      if lower.startswith("label:"):
          raw_label = line.split(":", 1)[1].strip().lower()
      elif lower.startswith("reasoning:"):
          reasoning = line.split(":", 1)[1].strip()
```

---

**Step 4 — Validate the label:**

```
Import VALID_LABELS from config. After parsing raw_label, check:

  if raw_label in VALID_LABELS:
      label = raw_label
  else:
      label = "unknown"

This handles cases where the model returns "Interview", "**interview**",
"Label: interview (interview)", or anything else that doesn't exactly match.
The lowercase conversion in Step 3 already handles capitalization, so only
truly wrong values fall through to "unknown".
```

---

**Step 5 — Handle errors gracefully:**

```
Wrap the entire function body in a try/except block:

  try:
      ... (steps 1–4)
      return {"label": label, "reasoning": reasoning}
  except Exception as e:
      return {"label": "unknown", "reasoning": f"Error: {str(e)}"}

What can go wrong:
  - Network/API error → exception from the client call
  - Response missing "Label:" line → raw_label never set → NameError or KeyError
  - max_tokens too low → response truncated mid-line, "Label:" line missing

Returning {"label": "unknown", ...} on any failure keeps the evaluation loop
running for all 20 episodes instead of crashing on episode 3.
```

---

### Return value structure

```python
{
    "label": str,      # one of VALID_LABELS, or "unknown" if invalid/error
    "reasoning": str,  # brief explanation from the LLM
}
```

---

## Notes on label quality

The classifier is only as good as your labels. If your training examples have
inconsistent or ambiguous labels, the LLM will learn the wrong pattern.

Before implementing the classifier, re-read `data/taxonomy.md` and double-check
any labels you're unsure about. Annotation quality is part of the lab.

## Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after implementing and testing both functions.*

**Test: what does the raw LLM response look like for one episode?**

```
Episode tested: [title]
Raw response text: [paste it here]
```

**How did you parse the label out of the response?**

```
[describe the string operations — strip, split, lower, etc.]
```

**Did any episodes return `"unknown"`? If so, why?**

```
[yes / no — if yes, what did the raw response look like?]
```

**One thing about the output format that surprised you:**

```
